NIFCA Project Deployment Guide


Can you add more logs so I can see what data was passed during the news posting 

● I'll add console logs to help you debug and see what data is being passed during the news posting    
   process. Let me first check the useNewsActions hook to see how the data is being sent:

● Search(pattern: "**/useNewsActions.js")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)
  ⎿  Session limit reached ∙ resets 12am
     /upgrade to increase your usage limit.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (Latest LTS recommended) - https://nodejs.org/
- npm (Comes with Node.js) - https://www.npmjs.com/

Installation
1. Extract the folder and place it in a desired file
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

Development Server
To start the development server, run:
   npm run dev
This will launch the project on a local server, usually at http://localhost:5173/.

Building for Production
To build the project for production, run:
   npm run build
This will generate optimized static files in the dist/ directory.

Previewing Production Build
To preview the built project locally, run:
   npm run preview

Linting
To check for linting errors, run:
   npm run lint

Deployment
Static Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
1. Run the build command:
   npm run build
2. Deploy the contents of the dist/ folder to your preferred hosting platform.

Deploying to a Server
If deploying on a server, ensure you:
- Install dependencies (npm install)
- Build the project (npm run build)
- Configure your server to serve the dist/ directory

Additional Notes
- TailwindCSS and DaisyUI are used for styling.
- React Router is used for navigation.

For any issues, refer to the respective documentation or raise an issue in the project repository.
